- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rykoko
- 👀 I’m interested in tech, sports, language learning and yoga.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and Django while trying to rememebr the JavaScript, CSS and HTML I learned many years ago!
- 💞️ I'm still in the learning process but I know my interest is in data analysis, collection, understanding etc. 
- 📫 Through GitHub is probably the best way as I'm not very active on social media --> Needed to detox myself off it!
